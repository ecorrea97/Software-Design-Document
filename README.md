Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client, The Gaming Room, desired the expansion of their existing Android game, "Draw It or Lose It," into a web-based version that could be played across multiple platforms. 
The software design needed to accommodate multiple teams with multiple players, ensure unique game and team names, and manage a single game instance in memory at any given time.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I think the requirements, constraints, and recommendations are well-articulated, making it easy to understand the project's scope and technical considerations.
The inclusion of a domain model and explanations of OOP principles further makes this document easier to understand.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Working through the design document helped in establishing a clear understanding of the project's goals and requirements before diving into coding. 
This upfront planning facilitated better decision-making during development, ensuring the code aligned with the client's needs and the project's constraints.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could revise one part, I would go over the evaluations table and recommendations at the end. I still feel like more could be said and details could be better explained to make better recommendations to the client. 
Maybe have another meeting with the client to get more feedback regarding the budget and other needs or constraints to really pinpoint which OS architectures, storage management, memory management, istribution system and networks, and security options would be the best fit. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The user's needs were central to the design process. The requirement for multi-platform accessibility led to the choice of web-based development. The need for multiple teams and players informed the design of the Game, Team, and Player classes. 
Considering user needs is crucial as it ensures the software meets its intended purpose and provides a positive user experience.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

The software design approach involved understanding the requirements, identifying constraints, and creating a domain model to represent the game's entities and their relationships. 
In the future, I would employ similar techniques, along with additional strategies like creating user stories, use case diagrams, and prototyping to gain a deeper understanding of user interactions and refine the design according to the feedback.
